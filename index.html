      <h2>Proposition: Filing a police complaint is worthless, as they lead to no actual justice or change.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="Futile_to_file.png" height = 500px width = 1000px alt="" />
          <figcaption>I used a Sankey Diagram inspired by the Minard graph to visualize 
            the journey of a civilian police complaint from when its filed to its outcome.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I used the <b>width of the flow lines</b> to indicate the quantity of 
            complaints that went to each outcome. Thicker lines indicate that
            more complaints went to that outcome. By showing how many complaints
            are disregarded with a really thick line and how few complaints 
            result in charges with a really thin line, I hope to convey how the 
            majority of complaints are disregarded or result in minimal punishment. 
            I dishonestly put extra emphasis on this by making all the flows to 
            punitive outcomes even thinner than they should be and the other flows thicker.
            <b>Score: -1</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Area is not the most effective visualize channel, so I used 
            <b>color of the flow lines</b> as a redundant encoding for the 
            quantity of complaints that went to each outcome. Deeper blues 
            indicate higher quantities. The deep blues make the thick flow lines
            look bolder, while the light blues make the thin flow lines look 
            even thinner. I performed the same dishonest techniques with this
            encoding as I did with the flow line width. <b>Score: -1</b>
          </li>
          <li>I used <b>node placement on the x-axis</b> to indicate how severe 
            the complaint's resulting punishment is. The further right the node
            is, the more severe the punishment is. More severe punishments require 
            more work and processes to achieve, which is represented through distance
            across the x-axis. <b>Score: 2</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            I used <b>color of the nodes</b> as a redundant encoding for outcome
            severity. Deeper shades of red indicate more severe punishment. To 
            highlight how being charged is the only actual severe outcome, I
            made the node for charges a very deep red, while all other nodes 
            are yellow or orange. <b>Score: 2</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of the punishment names don't do a good job describing what
            the punishment is, like "command-level discipline". Most of these
            punishments aren't too substantial. For example the most severe 
            instance of command-level discipline is losing ten vacation days.
            To show how most punishments are not very intense, I detailed each
            outcome in the <b>legend</b>. <b>Score: 1.5</b>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="Not_futile_to_file.png" height = 675 width = 900 alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            I used a line graph to illustrate that as time passes, more and more
            complaints are substantiated, resulting in some police reform.
            This conveys how the NYPD are taking complaints more seriously 
            and are looking to improve.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          I used <b> counts on the y-axis</b> instead of proportions. Since
          the number of complaints being filed every year increases, the number
          of substantiated complaints increase as well. This makes the linear 
          relationship between counts of substantiated complaints and year very
          clean and observable. Proportion of substantiated complaints also
          increases as time goes by, but the linear relationship is much weaker
          and noisier. <b>Score: -1 </b>
          </li>
          <li>
          I changed the <b>aspect ratio </b> of my graph to make it taller. This
          highlights the linear trend displayed within and makes it look steeper. 
          This reinforces the idea that more and more complaints are being 
          substantiated each year. <b>Score: 0 </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            I <b>removed the 2019 and 2020 data</b> from the dataset because
            they were not agreeing with the linear trend displayed for the other
            years. So, the graph only displays data from 1985 to 2018. 
            <b>Score: -2</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
